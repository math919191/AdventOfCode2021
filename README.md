# AdventOfCode2021
Advent type calendar for coding for 2021. I'm going to put my completed projects in here. 

## Why the formatting is weird
I started doing some of the puzzles in December 2021. I completed probably half of the problems -- the easier ones. I ran out of time to finish before the semester started.
I did not understand how to use github...I copied some of my code up because my uncle wanted to look at my code. 
Come April 2022...I finished Winter Semester 2022 and I am bored looking for something to do....I rediscovered advent and wanted to finish what I had started. During the semester, I learned how to use github, commit code, and a variety of concepts from my classes. I created a different set up I like better for getting the input and I seperated the days into classes rather than new projects, which makes a lot more sense than what I was doing earlier. 

I'm gonna leave the files from December the way they are because it reminds me of how far I've come. Programming is FAR less frustrating than it was because I have gained some experience, know the tools I have at my disposal, actually know how to use the debugger, and realizing that it's not the end of the world if I can figure it out as quickly as I want. I have lowered my expectations significantly in how quickly I expect to finish the problem and that has helped A LOT as well. Additionally, I am looking forward to Advent Of Code 2022 because I will have taken another semester of CS classes, hopefully finished Advent of Code 2021, and maybe even have a job programming. Just overall, having better abilities.  I also am doing this for my own enjoyment and not at all to beat anyone like I was in December. That makes a huge difference as well.
